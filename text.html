<p class="pawankalyan">Pawan Kalyan (born Konidela Kalyan Babu;[1] 2 September 1971[n 1]) is an Indian actor, filmmaker, philanthropist, and politician. His films are predominantly in Telugu cinema. Kalyan is the younger brother of actor-politician Chiranjeevi, and made his debut in the 1996 film Akkada Ammayi Ikkada Abbayi. He starred in Tholi Prema in 1998, which won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu that year.
Referred to as "Power Star" by his fans, Kalyan is known for films such as Gokulamlo Seeta, Suswagatham, Tholi Prema, Thammudu, Badri, Kushi, Jalsa, Gabbar Singh, Gopala Gopala and Attarintiki Daredi.[2] He received the Filmfare Award for Best Actor â€“ Telugu for Gabbar Singh while Attarintiki Daredi held the record of being the highest-grossing Telugu film.[3][4] He was listed 26th in 2013, 69th in 2017, and 24th in 2018 respectively in the Forbes India list of top 100 Celebrities.[5][6][7] He produces films under the banners Anjana Productions and Pawan Kalyan Creative Works Kalyan started his political career in 2008[46] as the president of Yuvarajyam,[47] the youth wing of Praja Rajyam Party which was started by his elder brother Chiranjeevi. He neither contested in elections nor did he hold any constitutional post during his days in Praja Rajyam Party. While he actively campaigned for the party, he was also hit with few health problems. Kalyan was struck with bouts of vomiting, as he was hit by a sunstroke during a roadshow at Vizag on 19 April 2009.[48] Later, in 2011, when Chiranjeevi merged his party[49] with Congress,[50] Kalyan took a break from political life,[citation needed] expressing his silent discontent with his brother's decision to merge the party,[citation needed] and started a new political party in 2014 called Jana Sena Party.</p>
